Facebook android app

the process of making it:

for start we created the login and signup page and made them work locally.
afterwards we moved on to the feed page and created recycle view in it with adapter that inflate 
every post to the feed page.
we moved on to setting like option and making it all look nice.
afterwards we added an adapter for comments(same logic like the posts) and handled adding comments
and likes for each of them for each post.
than we moved on to creating an menu page and made the share button to lead to it.
than we added posts from json file(10 like the assignment required).
while during all of this we added the rest of the necessary features like profile pic etc.
